# Miss-lane-seg
Use light semantic branch to complete the miss lane in lane segment mission.
In 2-classes segment mission, spatial branch is good enough to segment the lane, but is not robust. So we use the extra semantic branch to link up the spatial block to complete the miss part(excessive exposure reasons).
